## ESP32 RFID Reader with Data Logging to SD Card and Display on SSD1306

### Overview
This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller with RFID reader capabilities. The codebase is developed using the PlatformIO extension for Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The main functionalities include reading RFID tags, storing the tag information onto a micro SD card, and displaying relevant data on an SSD1306 OLED display.

### Components
- **ESP32 Development Board**: The ESP32 serves as the main microcontroller in the project, responsible for RFID tag reading, data logging, and display control.
- **RFID Reader**: An RFID reader module is connected to the ESP32 to capture RFID tag information.
- **Micro SD Adapter**: A micro SD card adapter is interfaced with the ESP32 to enable data logging capabilities.
- **SSD1306 OLED Display**: An SSD1306 OLED display is used to visualize relevant project information such as RFID tag data.

### Functionality
1. **RFID Tag Reading**: The ESP32 continuously scans for RFID tags in its vicinity using the connected RFID reader module.
2. **Data Logging to SD Card**: When an RFID tag is detected, the corresponding data (such as tag ID or metadata) is logged onto a micro SD card for future reference.
3. **Display Output on SSD1306**: Relevant information, such as the detected RFID tag data or system status, is displayed in real-time on the SSD1306 OLED display.
4. **PlatformIO Development**: The project is developed using the PlatformIO ecosystem within VSCode, offering a streamlined development experience with features like IntelliSense, debugging, and project management.

### Implementation
- The ESP32 firmware is developed using the Arduino framework, allowing for easy integration of libraries and rapid prototyping.
- RFID tag detection and data parsing are handled within the ESP32 firmware, leveraging RFID library functionalities.
- File operations for data logging to the micro SD card are managed through built-in ESP32 SD card libraries.
- Display control and data rendering on the SSD1306 OLED display are implemented using appropriate SSD1306 display libraries.
- The entire project is organized and managed within the PlatformIO environment, facilitating code versioning, library management, and project configuration.

### Use Cases
- **Access Control Systems**: The project can be employed in access control systems where RFID tags are used for authentication or entry management.
- **Inventory Management**: It can also find applications in inventory management systems to track and log items using RFID tags.
- **Security Systems**: The system can be integrated into security setups to monitor and record movements or access events.

### Conclusion
The ESP32 RFID reader project with SD card data logging and SSD1306 display integration offers a versatile solution for various IoT applications requiring RFID tag detection, data storage, and real-time display capabilities. Its flexible architecture and PlatformIO development environment make it suitable for both prototyping and deployment in commercial or industrial settings.
